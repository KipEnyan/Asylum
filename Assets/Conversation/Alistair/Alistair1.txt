Good afternoon, Elizabeth.  I think you will remember 
me.  Even after all these years, I suspect
my case still haunts you.  At the last day
of the trial, when I was acquitted, your look of utter
frustration and hatred was one for the ages.
With that in mind, I expect you’ll be wondering why I’m 
writing this to you.  Truth be told, I don’t entirely 
know.  I suppose that for all our differences, you’re the 
one most likely to understand my work, 
my true purpose here.  Justice is at best
difficult to define or carry out; in a 
world swamped by corruption and idiocy, 
this difficulty increased tenfold.  Perhaps here, 
in this place and time, you and I will both find some peace.
