Renata is quite the curious individual.  She has some of the symptoms of sociopathy,
some of the symptoms of bipolar disorder, and is a convicted pedophile.  As far as
I am aware of she is the only pedophile rights activist on the planet.  My work 
with her will be functionally quite different from the others.  She does not think
she needs to be fixed or cured or similar- she has no regrets and is not ashamed
of her choices.  I believe she has some deeply seated trauma related to this topic, 
most likely regular childhood abuse, that has done an extreme degree of damage to 
her psyche.  We will need to work together to delve into her past and reopen those 
wounds, in order to get them to heal properly.
