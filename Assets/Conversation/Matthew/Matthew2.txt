This is unbelievable.  I mean, sending me to that 
worthless “Doctor Friedrich” was already bad enough.
But this is way too much.  How’m I 
supposed to get “socialized” or whatever while living in 
some sketchy house for the insane, who knows 
how many miles from real life?  When I try explaining 
to the doctor how stupid this is, he just gives 
me that dumb smile all his kind must practice 
every day, and tells me, “Write in your journal, 
that will help.”  So here I am.  
This place is the definition of crazy.  
We’ve got a pedophile teacher and a psychopathic 
murderer, the Incredible Hulk, and an aspiring PhD 
who can’t remember what she had for breakfast.  
Anyway, I’d probably better get back to 
the main room.  Our first group therapy session
will be starting soon.
