Matthew appears on the outside to be just another 
spoiled teenager.  The offspring of wealthy parents,
he has wanted for nothing.  Unfortunately, society 
never bothered looking below the surface, because 
for all his fortune his destiny is not a happy one.
My initial diagnosis would be a combination of 
crippling depression with social anxiety.  Add 
parental neglect and bullying peers and we have 
created a teenager who hides deep within a shell
of resentment and low self esteem.  Any time he
feels threatened heâ€™ll either lash out or dive
even farther.  I will have to find a way through
to the frightened little boy curled up inside 
and offer him a hand.
