Marissa: Good morning.
Matthew: ‘Morning.
Marissa: What’s your name.
Matthew: *pause* Matt.
Marissa: I’m Marissa.  Pleased to meet you.
Matthew: *pause* Yeah.  Uh...you too.
Marissa: So what are you in here for?
Matthew: Depression, I guess...
Marissa: Aww, that’s no fun.  Are you taking meds?
Matthew: Not since I got here.  I guess Doctor Lee
 wants to 
get us all to our natural states.  He said something
 about a base line.
Marissa: Oh, that makes sense.  Say...do you mind if
 I ask you something?
Matthew: Sure, I guess.
Marissa: This may sound weird but...do you know anything
 about me?
Mattew: You were at Harvard studying for your PhD, your 
dean denied your request to run human trials, and you
 self experimented which damaged your brain.  Enough to
 create some pretty bad amnesia.  And then you did something
 stupid and illegal, I don’t know what, and you wound up here.
Marissa: Just a shot in the dark, but have we had this 
conversation before.
Matthew: *pause* Yeah.
Marissa: Uh...how many times?
Matthew: This is round 8.
Marissa: Oh dear.  I’m so sorry.
Matthew: It’s fine.  I’m getting pretty good at it.  Didn’t
even have to use my notes this time.
Marissa: You have notes?
Matthew: Well...its either you learn everything from me or
 the doctor.  I guess I figure you might as well get your 
 life story from an average face.  And I don’t want to 
 accidentally miss something important.
Marissa: Aw, well thanks!  Is there anything else I should 
know about.
Matthew: You should go look at your door.  It has your schedule.
But..uh...let me know if you have questions or need help finding
anything.  I’m usually just watching TV.
Marissa: Thanks!
