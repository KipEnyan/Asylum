So...its been 2 years.  The last thing I remember, at least concretely, is pain. 
I had finished the first round of experiments but the old fogies on the board either 
couldn’t or wouldn’t see progress.  Without access to the labs, and living on my
leftover savings, I could only work with very limited safety precautions.  I must
have measured something wrong.  Anyways, the next thing I know I wake up here. 
When I walked out of the room, I met a nice boy who was able to point out some 
things to me and then the facilities’ doctor provided further assistance.  What
the doctor told me is pretty scary, though- it seems that this will happen again. 
Tomorrow.  And the next day.  And probably the one after that, too.  And it will
never stop, unless the doctor can find a cure.  Looks like he holds all the cards now.
