Still no progress.  Looking through the pages, 
I have only the first day as an entry.  Assuming that 
I experience every day like today, that isn’t much of a 
surprise, since I don’t really feel like doing this right now.  
The doctor insisted though- he is quite adamant 
that the more I write in here, the more I build up a set of experiences 
I can refer to at any time, the more I get used to referring to 
them, that I’ll be able to build my memories back together.  
He wouldn’t tell me what happened in the past  
2 years though.  I’ve tried asking the strange philosopher, Alistair,
as well, but no answers were helpful.  
I should go to sleep now, but I don’t want to.  
I don’t want to lose this...whatever this is.  
This day.  This snapshot of life.  
Tomorrow, someone will wake up in this bed, 
and have to deal with that day.  But they won’t be me...
they won’t have today.  All they’ll have are some 
words on paper that they have to trust.  This is all I know how 
to give you...so read it carefully and be as prepared as 
you can.  Because while you may not be me, 
we’re both Marissa, and that will have to be good enough.
