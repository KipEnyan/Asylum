Marissa is a truly tragic case: a young woman with great intellectual promise cut short
through dangerous experimentation.  After self-experimenting with a biochemical drug, 
she sustained severe trauma to her pre-frontal lobe.  As far as therapists and psychoanalysts 
have been able to determine, she remembers things cleanly from before the incident, but it
would seem that sleeping, daydreaming, and even getting distracted can reset her memory. 
Beyond that, she has fuzzy memories of certain striking moments, including the conviction
in her court case and someone screaming.  I believe that by exercising her memory in practice, 
she can work towards a better future.  Iâ€™m not so sure that she will be able to recover the
memories she has lost, but I will do everything in my power to help her in that aim.
