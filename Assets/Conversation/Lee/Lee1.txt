Setup is a success.  Individuals have been
gathered from all walks of life; 
a large spectrum of ages, races,and genders.
My timeline is regrettably short; 
I was only given 6 months to do a lifetimeâ€™s work.  
Nevertheless, everything must proceed
according to the plan.  My object is clear 
and straightforward: this place shall be the beginning
of the end of the cancer to humanity that is
the mental disorder, in all its deadly shapes 
and sizes.  I have seen individuals and families
torn apart by the failure of their own minds.  
It is my destiny to ensure that before mankind 
moves one more step forward, towards longer lives,
towards the stars, towards creating
a civilization that spans the universe, that this
crippling flaw in our system is corrected and
does not cause our downfall.  This is the future;
this is my design.
