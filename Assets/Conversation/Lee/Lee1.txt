Setup is a success.  Individuals have been gathered 
from all walks of life, all ages, genders, and races.
They have such a beautiful diversity of illnesses, 
stemming from everything from childhood trauma to
deeply seated delusions.  My timeline is regrettably short.
  I was only given 6 months to do a lifetimeâ€™s work.
Nevertheless, everything shall proceed according to the 
plan.  Each month I shall bring things to the next level. 
By the time we are done here, I will have systematically 
destroyed every major disorder.  This is the
future; this is my design.
